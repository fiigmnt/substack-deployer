# Substack Contract Deployer

> ‚ú®Substack, but on-chain ‚ú®

## TL;DR

Deploys a mintable 721 contract of any [substack.com](https://substack.com) article via the [Zora Drops contract](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-drops-contracts).

## How it Works

1. Copy a Substack article URL into the form and press UPLOAD TO IPFS.
2. The article (and all associated images) are uploaded to IPFS as a raw HTML document.
3. Fill in contract details (similar to the zora create tool).
4. Press DEPLOY ‚úåÔ∏è.
5. Check your [Zora collections](https://zora.co/collections) once the transaction is confirmed.

## What's Next

- This project is currently a standalone Next.js application.
- Ideally, the tool will also create a "mint" block and add it to the published article (we currently rely on the Zora mint embed tool).
